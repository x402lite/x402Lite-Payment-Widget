# x402Lite-Payment-Widget
The x402Lite Payment Widget is a lightweight, open-source demo that lets developers embed micro-transaction payments into any website or app using the x402 Protocol (HTTP 402) and ERC-8004 payment standard. It enables instant, wallet-free payments (e.g., 0.01 USDC per request) for APIs, AI agents, or digital services.
